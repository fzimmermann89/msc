\section{Sample Preparation}
Magnetite Nanoparticles coated with Oleic Acid dispersed in Toluene were bought from NN-Labs, inhibited Methylmethacrylate (MMA) and Etyhlhexylmethacrylate (EHMA)  (Sigma Aldrich) were filtered using a prefilled column to remove the Inhibitor,  2,2-azo-bis-isobutyrylnitrile (AIBN) (Sigma Aldrich) was used as thermally activated radical initiator as received. Polystyrene (Sigma Aldrich, MW XXX) was used as received. As solvents, Methanol, Toluene and Chloroform were used.
\subsection{Nanoparticles in Polystyrene Matrix}
The nanoparticles were precipitated with Methanol, centrifuged and redispersed in Chloroform at a concentration of 25\,mg/ml, whereas the weight of nanoparticles includes the weight of the oleic acid capping. Polystyrene was dissolved in Chloroform at a concentration of 250\,mg/ml and different volumes of the nanoparticles solution were added (to account for the different iron contents) to 5\,ml of the Polystyrene solution (see \fref{tab:samplePS}). After ensuring dispersion by strong sonication, fractions of XXX\,ul the solution were dropped onto glass slides and dried. After drying, the films were carefully removed from the glass slides.
As an iron containing control sample, 60mg FeCl3 and XXX Polystyrene were dissolved in 6ml acetone, sonicated and  fractions of XXX were dropped onto slowly spinning glass slides (XXX rpm for XX 5\,min) and carefully removed after drying.

\subsection{Nanoparticles in Poly(MMA/EHMA)  Matrix}
As a second nanoparticle in polymer sample, a AIBN initiated Poly(MMA/EHMA) polymerisation with magnetite nanoparticles was performed. 
The nanoparticle solution was concentrated to XXX in toluene by precipitation, centrifugation and redispersion. To account for the different iron concentration, to different amounts of the nanoparticle solution and additional toluene, 800\,ul of EHMA was added each (see \fref{tab:sampleCP}). After strong sonication to ensure dispersion, 3.2\,ml of MMA were added and the solution was bubbled with N$_2$ for 5\,min. To start the polymerisation, 20\,mg of AIBN were added and the solution was bubbled again with N$_2$  for 10\,min before heating it up to XXX using a water bath under weak sonication using a sonic bath. The mixture was kept at XXX for XXX.
The vials were uncapped and the polymer dried for 12h at XXX. The polymer was removed from the vials and cut into slices of approximatly XXX thickness using a slow spinning diamond saw.
As a control sample, the polymerisation was performed without any nanoparticles added.

\subsection{Sample Characterisation}
Before sample preparation, the iron oxide nanoparticles were deposited on a silicon nitride membrane and imaged using a FEI Tecnai microscope the measure the size distribution.


SAXS measurements of the prepared nanoparticle polymer foils where performed at the SSRL beamline 1-5 .

\section{Setup}
The setup used at EH5 at SACLA is shown in \fref{fig:setup}. 

The sample was mounted on an XXX axis stage to allow scanning perpendicular the the incoming beam, ensure perpendicularly of the scanning directions to the beam while ensuring a parallel alignment of the sample surface to the octal detector.

Two MPCCD detectors were used: A dual detector with two tiles, each 512x1024 pixels perpendicular to the FEL beam in a distance of 1\,m and a Short Working Distance octal detector, consisting of eight 512x1024 tiles, parallel to the sample surface in a distance $d_{octal}$ ranging from XXX to XXX cm.

An L-shaped aluminum plate was installed to reduce stray light as well as to allow mounting of the beamstop and filters between sample and detector.

The angle between incoming FEL and Sample is XXX. Behind the sample, an stray light filter, beamstop and (depending on the sample) a filter foil is installed. The Dual detector is mounted $d_{dual}$=1\,m away from the sample in a XXX angle. To reduce air scattering, a vacuum tube is installed in the path from sample to Dual.}

\subsubsection{Crystal orientation}
For determining the relative orientation of the crystal with regards to the detector, Kossel lines as described in \fref{chap:kossel} can be used.  A semi-automatic alignment program was developed (\fref{fig:kosselfit}) and used the find the crystal orientation (\fref{tab:kosselfit}) As initial parameters, 5.65\,\AA\, lattice constant, 9.25\,keV energy and 800\,px detector distance and the result of a simple 2d cubic fit for the values of the translational shift were used.
