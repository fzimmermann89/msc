\chapter{Experimental Verification}
An initial experimental proof of principle experiment was performed at the SACLA FEL.
The experiments consisted of three parts: First, reproducing XXX and imaging projection of the focal volume of the FEL by using metal foils as samples, performing a measurement of the K$\alpha$  fluorescence and an reconstruction in the small angle regime. Second, moving the a smaller length scale and try to image nanoparticles. And Third, leaving the small angle regime and record the fluoresccne of a single crystal and perform a reciprocal space reconstruction.
\section{Sample Preparation and Characterization}
As an nanoparticle sample, spherical iron oxide nanoparticles where chosen. To improve the number of detected fluorescence photons per FEL shot, the decision was made to have many particles many for each shot within the focus. This ensures a higher number of fluorescence photons recorded and basically eliminates the possibility of having shots without any particles inside the focus. 

Magnetite Nanoparticles coated with Oleic Acid dispersed in Toluene were bought from NN-Labs, inhibited Methylmethacrylate (MMA) and Etyhlhexylmethacrylate (EHMA)  (Sigma Aldrich) were filtered using a prefilled column to remove the Inhibitor,  2,2-azo-bis-isobutyrylnitrile (AIBN) (Sigma Aldrich) was used as thermally activated radical initiator as received. Polystyrene (Sigma Aldrich, MW XXX) was used as received. As solvents, Methanol, Toluene and Chloroform were used.
\subsection{Nanoparticles in Polystyrene Matrix}
The nanoparticles were precipitated with Methanol, centrifuged and redispersed in Chloroform at a concentration of 25\,mg/ml, whereas the weight of nanoparticles includes the weight of the oleic acid capping. Polystyrene was dissolved in Chloroform at a concentration of 250\,mg/ml and different volumes of the nanoparticles solution were added (to account for the different iron contents) to 5\,ml of the Polystyrene solution (see \fref{tab:samplePS}). After ensuring dispersion by strong sonication, fractions of XXX\,ul the solution were dropped onto glass slides and dried. After drying, the approximately 200\,um thick films were carefully removed from the glass slides.
As an iron containing control sample, 60mg FeCl3 and XXX Polystyrene were dissolved in 6ml acetone, sonicated and  fractions of XXX were dropped onto slowly spinning glass slides (XXX rpm for XX 5\,min) and carefully removed after drying.

\subsection{Nanoparticles in Poly-(methyl methacrylate / etylhexyl methacrylate)  Matrix}
As a second nanoparticle in polymer sample, an Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) initiated methyl methacrylate (MMA)/etylhexyl methacrylate (EHMA) polymerisation with magnetite nanoparticles was performed. 
The nanoparticle solution was concentrated to XXX in toluene by precipitation, centrifugation and redispersion. To account for the different iron concentration, to different amounts of the nanoparticle solution and additional toluene, 800\,ul of EHMA was added each (see \fref{tab:sampleCP}). After strong sonication to ensure dispersion, 3.2\,ml of MMA were added and the solution was bubbled with N$_2$ for 5\,min. To start the polymerisation, 20\,mg of AIBN were added and the solution was bubbled again with N$_2$  for 10\,min before heating it up to XXX using a water bath under weak sonication using a sonic bath. The mixture was kept at XXX for XXX.
The vials were uncapped and the polymer dried for 12h at XXX. The polymer was removed from the vials and cut into slices of approximatly XXX thickness using a slow spinning diamond saw.
As a control sample, the polymerisation was performed without any nanoparticles added.

\subsection{Nanoparticle Sample Characterisation}
Before sample preparation, the iron oxide nanoparticles as received were diluted with Toluene, deposited on a silicon nitride membrane and imaged using a FEI Tecnai microscope  (see \fref{fig:tem}).  For each of the three nominal sizes, 3 different areas on the membrane were analyzed using ImageJ, resulting in mean radii of 8.3$\pm$1.7\,nm (nominal "20\,nm" diameter) 4.1$\pm$0.8 \,nm	("10\,nm" diameter) 3.1$\pm$0.6\,nm ("5\,nm"). In the TEM images, the effect of the oleic acid ligands used to stabilize the nanoparticle dispersion can be seen as the inter-particle distance.

SAXS measurements of the prepared nanoparticle polymer foils where performed at the SSRL beamline 1-5. Samples were measured at 12\,keV for at two different spots for 5\,min each and averaged, a subtraction of the polymer matrix background was performed and a size distribution of spherical particles with hardsphere interaction was fitted to the radial profile. The low-q area is dominated by aggregate formation, which cannot be precisely quantified due to stray light and limited measuring range and is accounted for by a guinier-porod function, see \fref{fig:saxsps}  and  \fref{fig:saxspmma} \cite{percus1958,feigin1987,Ilavsky2009}.
The measurements do not show a clear and significant difference between the two polymer matrices. According to the regressions, the aggregates seem to have a radius of gyration of 20-30\,nm (the straylight limits the measurement validity in those small q areas), the porod $P$ of 2.5-3.8 suggests a dimensionality of the aggregates between 2 and 3.  \cite{feigin1987,lili2005}. The radii of the form factor agree within the corresponding margin of error with the values of determined by TEM measurements, the difference between the radius parameters of the structure factors and the form factor is most likely caused by the thin layer of oleic acid ligands between aggregating particles.

The SAXS measurements give a reasonably good insight into the expected results of the IDI scheme measurement of the same sample, which will differ due to the iron specificity and the smaller focal volume in the latter.  

\subsection{GaAs Crystal Films}
As a crystalline sample GaAs was chosen for its simple fcc structure and large product of the gallium K-shell fluorescence Energy and lattice constant. The samples were prepared by Ben Reeves at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility. 
Using MOCVD, 50\,nm GaAs, 400\,nm AlGaAs as an etch stop and finally a 5\,um GaAs film were grown on an epi-ready (100)±0.1° GaAs substrate. The speciman was cut into 12\,mm\,x\,15\,mm pieces, each glued to an approx. 100\,um thick fused silica cover slip with the 5\,um film layer facing towards the silica. The substrate and the AlGaAs layer were selectively etched away via C6H8O7:H2O2 and HF:H2O wet etches, respectively. This left 5\,um thin GaAs films glued onto the the quartz slides (see \fref{fig:gaas_sample}).  XRD with Cu K-alpha was used to measure the width of the (004) GaAs bragg peak as 0.004°, indicative of high quality single crystals.

\section{Setup}
The setup used at EH5 at SACLA is shown in \fref{fig:setup}. 

The sample was mounted in an XXX angle to the beam on an XXX axis stage to allow scanning of the sample, ensure perpendicularly of the scanning directions to the beam to stay within the Rayleigh length of approx. XXX\,um while also ensuring a parallel alignment of the sample surface to one of the detectors. Overall, two MPCCD detectors were used: A Dual detector with two tiles, each 512x1024 pixels perpendicular to the FEL beam in a distance of 1\,m and a Short Working Distance Octal detector, consisting of eight 512x1024 tiles, parallel to the sample surface in a distance $d_{octal}$ ranging from XXX to XXX cm. To supress absorption and more importantly, air scattering, a vacuum pipe with Kapton windows was installed in between the sample and the Dual detector
An L-shaped aluminum plate was installed to reduce stray light as well as to allow mounting of the beamstop and filters to suppress coherent scattering and K$\beta$ fluorescence and between sample and detector.

The samples were scanned with a mean step size of 20\,um in horizontal direction (fast scanning direction) and 20\,um in vertical direction.between shots. The step size was chosen based on the crater size visible with an optical microscope of approximately 5-10\,um for the samples and energies used in the experiment.

The Dual detector is mounted $d_{dual}$=1\,m away from the sample in a XXX angle. To reduce air scattering, a vacuum tube is installed in the path from sample to Dual.}

\section{Data Processing and Analysis}
As the amount of recorded data is huge, an efficient strategy for filtering on shots, preprocessing the data to eliminate interference and finally reconstruction has to be implemented.
\subsection{Preprocessing}









\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{0.2\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/mask_dual.png}
	\end{subfigure}

	\caption[Usable detector area]{Usable detector area (gray) of the Dual detector for foil samples (left) and the Octal detector (right) for nanoparticle samples) after signal correction and statistical filtering. Masks are created by considering the intersection of good areas for each run, in order be able to use the mask and therefor number of correlation pairs for samples that will be compared to each other.}	
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Shot filtering}
A first rough filtering pass on the recorded data is done on the following criteria: Reported beam energy > 250\,uJ, beam energy in the hutch being not more than one standard deviation below the mean energy and the distance on the sample to the closest neighboring shot not being less than one standard deviation of the mean distance to the next neighbor for the sample (to remove shots with stopped, turning or still accelerating scanning motors). Furthermore, the scanning range occupied by the sample is identified by the fluorescence intensity on the octal detector and shots, were the X-ray beam does not hit the sample are removed.

 
\paragraph{Filtering for Impurities}
On some of the samples, areas can be identified where the relative fluorescence intensities at different energies change. An example is shown in \fref{fig:xrf}: For a 500\,nm thick iron foil, a spot can be seen where the intensity at 8\,keV is much higher than expected. As this is most likely due to impurities on the sample, those areas are identified and excluded from further analysis.

Before doing the reconstruction, a final filtering pass is done on the images, keeping only those shots where the pulse energy > XXX, the measured photon energy is within two standard deviations of the median,
the ratio of pulse energy in the experimental hutch to further upstream in the optical hutch is within one standard deviation of the mean and the ratio of the intensity on all 4 edges of the detectors as well as  the total intensity on both detectors  to the pulse energy to is not lower than two and not higher than four standard deviations of the mean.
For the last criterion, the scanning area is cut into equally sized squares with a side length of 1/100th the horizontal scanning range and the filtering is done for each square. This increases the statistics and is sufficient to remove bad areas on the sample as well as areas where shadowing might have occurred.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/xrf.png}
	\caption[Exemplary relative intensity of the 6 keV and 8 keV photon peak on the detector for different scanning positions on the sample]{Exemplary relative intensity of the 6 keV and 8 keV photon peak on the detector for different scanning positions on the sample. In this iron sample, a localized impurity, most likely copper, is clearly visible and can be masked out .}
	\label{fig:xrf}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Detector masking}
Masks for both detectors were created based on the standard deviation in dark images not being more than than 4 standard deviations higher than the mean, the mean intensity over images taken of a sample not being more than 3 standard deviations lower or higher than the mean as well as XXXXX.
The masks were dilated by 5 pixels.

\paragraph{Detector Artifacts}
During the experiment, an unnoticed failure of the electronics of the octal detector has occurred, manifesting as periodic noise on most of the detector tiles at a much higher level than expected (see \fref{fig:octalissue} for an illustration). Not all columns of a tile are affected (in contrast to common-mode effects commonly encountered with different detectors). As the overall affected area of the detector is substantial and the noise leaks through the photon counting scheme by slightly influencing the probability of a pixel being considered a photon hit, causing correlations and therefore artifacts in the reconstruction in one direction, a correction was applied to the affected columns of affected tiles of the detector. For the correction, the median over the affected columns is calculated (for each of the eight separate read out areas of a tile independently) and subtracted. This reduces the artifact, but doesn't fully remove it. As the artifact in the reconstructions is limited to low $q$ compared to the expected positions of the Bragg peaks, no further correction as been applied.

A periodic noise is visible. The mean spatial spectrum (over the rows) for each column of the tile is shown on the right. The periodic noise is not uniformly affecting all the columns of the tile.}
	\label{fig:octalissue}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Spectra}
The background subtracted and masked detector images are used to create spectra. On these spectra, a regression with a model consisting of peaks at multiples of the K$_\alpha$, K$_\beta$ and of the excitation energy with an initial FWHM of 500\,eV and intensities following a negative binomial distribution (signal) or Poisson distribution (scattering noise) is performed, minimizing the squared difference the logarithmic values. To roughly approximate the charge sharing, a numerical convolution with a  window of the shape
\begin{equation}
	w (x)= (1-p)\delta(x)+\rect\left(\frac{x-1/2}{E_{signal}}\right)*\frac{p}{E_{signal}}
\end{equation}
is performed, thus smearing the peaks to lower energies with a strength parameter $p$ (initialized as 25\%).
With this regression, an estimate for the number of modes of the binomial distribution as well as for the mean number of signal and scattering photons is found.

The recorded data is categorized into a smaller number of groups by the apparent similarity of the spectra : The foil data is group into the classes, one for copper foils, one for 10um thick iron foils and one for 500\,nm thick foils.


\paragraph{Photon counting}

The mean number of signal and scattering photons found from the spectra as well as the peak width and the  charge sharing point spread function for the detectors are used to find the thresholds for a classification of the pixel values into signal photon numbers for each of the groups as described in \fref{sec:chargesharing} by simulating 1000 images with 4096x4096 pixels with the determined K$_\alpha$, K$_\beta$ and scattering intensities, applying the charge sharing simulation and using the determined FWHM as a (assumed Gaussian) detector noise to estimate the number of signal photons corresponding with the highest probability to each energy bin of 10\,eV. This is done once  considering the K$_\beta$ photons as noise and once as signal, leading the different thresholds.

Furthermore, a third way of photon counting is done by simple rounding to the closest number of signal photons, not considering any scattering or other sources of noise. 










As shown in \fref{fig:spectrum}, the background corrected and masked spectrum of the detector shows peaks at multiplex of the fluorescence and excitation energy with a FWHM of .... . 


As discussed in \fref{chap:simulation}, the number of fluorescence photons can be estimated...

\paragraph{Crystal orientation}
For determining the relative orientation of the crystal with regards to the detector, Kossel lines as described in \fref{chap:kossel} can be used.  A semi-automatic alignment program was developed (\fref{fig:kosselfit}) to aid with the procedure: 

For each sample, the images are split into sets of 5000 shots and (after filtering for hot pixels and cutting bellow a noise threshold of 2\,keV), the mean is taken. To better distinguish the Kossel lines from uniform fluorescence, a Gaussian blurred version ($\sigma$=20\, px) is subtracted (see \fref{fig:kosselgaasmean} for examples). The Kossel lines are identified visually and the local maxima in the 20x20\,px surrounding block of a selected Kossel line are considered as points on the Kossel line. A least-square regression is performed by varying the rotation angles and detector translation as described in \fref{chap:kossel}. 
As initial parameters, a 5.65\,\AA\, lattice constant, 9.25\,keV energy, 14\,cm detector distance and the result of a 2D cubic fit to the fluorescence background for the values of the x- and y-shifts are used. 

The used lines are shown in \fref{fig:kosselgaaslines} and \fref{tab:kosselpeaks}, the results are shown in \fref{tab:kosselfit} as mean over the sets for each sample and maximum deviation from the mean as an error estimation.

The detector shift is corrected before calculating the correlations, the rotation angles are used afterwards to determine the expected position of Bragg peaks in the reconstruction.

\subsection{Reconstruction}
For the foil data, the small angle approximation is valid and each pixel can be thought of as having the same XXX angle, permitting using the pixelwise correlation as a reconstruction.

For the nanoparticle data, detection angle is higher and therefor the $\delta q$ is lower for pixels further of axis. Therefor, for each pixel the $q$ value is calculated and a radial correlation with the corrected values	 is performed.

For the crystal data, a full 3d correlation in $q$ space is performed.


\section{Results}
\subsection{Imaging the Focus}

The regression of the spectra results in a mean K$_{\alpha}$ photon count per pixel of 0.004$\pm$0.001 (500\,nm iron foil) to 0.041$\pm$0.001 (20\,um copper foil). The mode number could not be reasonably estimated for the 500\,nm iron sample due to the influence of air scattering and fluorescence stemming from the experimental setup and low number of signal photons. For the other samples, a the regression provides a rough estimate of 15-25. This number seems lower than expected, but one has to keep in mind that the regression scheme as a low sensitivity for higher $M$ values due to the diminishing gradient and might underestimate the number of modes. Nevertheless, this is an indicator that the $M$ is much higher than the "optimal" value for unpolarized of light of $M=2$, resulting in severely reduced signal and therefor SNR.

The charge sharing approximation parameter $p$ is found to be 0.43$\pm$0.01, meaning roughly 40\% of the photon hits are affected. The simplifications of assuming a uniform charge cloud by using a convolution windows with a flat side lobe leads to disagreement between the slightly curved histograms and the flat regressions in the valleys between integer multiples of the single photon energy.

The reconstruction if performed once without discretization and only applying a threshold of 1500\,eV and once with discretization into photons. 




The excited volume can in the horizontal direction be approximated as a rectangular function with a width of $\sqrt{2}$-times the thickness of the foil used, due to the 45° angle, if the (horizontal) FWHM of the focus is much smaller than the thickness of the foil and ignoring absorption.  In the vertical direction, the volume is limited by the (vertical) FWHM of the focus and can be (roughly) approximated to be Gaussian. 
In the small angle approximation, the reconstruction is the magnitude squared of the 2D Fourier transform of the volume (see XXX). As the magnitude squared of the Fourier transform of a Gaussian with FWHM $f$ is another Gaussian with FWHM $\frac{4\sqrt{2}\log{2}}{f}$ and the magnitude squared of the Fourier transform of a rectangular function with width $w$ is proportional to $\sinc^2{\left(\frac{q w}{2}\right)}$
\footnote{If the foil were thicker, the absorption length $a$ could not be ignored and the more complicated $\left|\mathscr{F}\left(e^{-\frac{x}{a}} \Pi \left(\frac{x}{w}\right)\right)\right|^2 \propto \frac{\cosh \left(\frac{w}{a}\right)-\cos (q w)}{a^2 q^2+1}$
 could be used instead.}, a 2D least-squares regression of the product of those functions is performed with the reconstructed image to estimate the focal FWHM \cite{butz2015}. As the horizontal direction is under sampled, the horizontal profile will not be resolved in the reconstruction. To account for the binning in the reconstruction, the function used for the regression is sampled at 25x the resolution in both directions and averaged (corresponding to a convolution with an rectangular sampling kernel), reducing the effect of under sampling on the values determined by the regression. Furthermore, a rotation parameter is introduced to account for slight misalignment of the detector.

For a 5\,um Copper foil placed at three different positions, at the nominal focus and two positions further upstream, results of the auto-correlation reconstruction are shown in \fref{fig:Cu5umreco2d}.
The regression allows an estimation of the focal width in vertical direction at nominal focus of (240$\pm$20)\,nm and while defocused by 250\,um of (380$\pm$40)\, nm (the stated errors only include regression uncertainty).
In \fref{fig:fereco2d} the results for 10\,um and 500\,nm iron foils as well as an example of the result of the regression is shown.
For all three foils, the signal amplitude in focal position determined by regression is 0.004$\pm$0.001 and no significant difference between iron and copper can be observed. 

The observed intensity correlation is a factor of 2-4 less than previously measured by Inoue et al \cite{inoue2019}. This might be the combination of a longer pulse length and the only partially by the regression corrected undersampling.

This is used to extrapolate the peak amplitude in the masked areas. \textbf{(b)} Results for the 500\,nm Iron foil at focus as well as at two defocused positions. The SNR is low and the signal almost indistinguishable from noise.}

As the 5\,um and 10\,um foils suffer from severe undersampling along the horizontal direction, for comparison the results for an 500\,um Iron are shown in \fref{fig:fe500nmreco2d}. Even though the effect is just barley visible, due to the much lower number of photons from such a thin sample and therefore lower SNR for the same number of images used, the result shows a broader peak in the horizontal direction, as expected.

The reconstructions have been performed on 4000 images each (10\% of all good shots recorded for this sample, see histogram on the left)  selected by excitation pulse energy estimates by upstream energy detectors as surrogate for the pulse length, similar to \cite{inoue2019}. Regression of the amplitude as (as described in the main text) shows a slight difference: 0.0038$\pm$0.0007 for the low energy shots, 0.0043$\pm$0.0007 for the medium energy shots and 0.0052$\pm$0.0007 for the high energy shots. This suggests dropping low energy shots from the reconstruction to improve the SNR.}

The detector artifacts are almost completely removed in those images. \textbf{(b)} Radial profiles and standard error of the mean of the calculated $g^2$ of two differently sized nanoparticles in the two different polymer matrices.

Using a sample with just the polymer, without any added iron (neither nanoparticles nor atomic), the influence of air scattering on the correlations can be examined, using an iron chloride in polymer sample, there are rougly equal amounts photons at the iron K-energy as in the nanoparticle samples and the effect of uncorrected detector artifacts could be seen. Neither seem to causes a strong correlation signal (see \fref{fig:resnano2d}).
