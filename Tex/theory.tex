As the main principle of IDI is using intensity correlations of X-ray fluorescence, a basic recapitulation of the underlying definitions used in both simulations and the experimental application as well as (semi-) classical approach to coherence and the experiment of Hanbury Brown and Twiss will be given.


\section{X-Ray Fluorescence}
X-ray fluorescence is emitted if atoms are ionised leaving vacancies in the inner shells, which are subsequently filled by electrons of higher energy levels while the energy difference is emitted as photons, compared to the non-radiating Auger decay which, for K-shell vacancies, is more likely for lighter atoms up to atomic number ~30 \cite{santra2009}.  The finite lifetime of the excited states cause a predominantly Lorentzian line shape \cite{van2001}. In the experimental section, iron, copper and gallium atoms are considered -- the relevant emission energies, the experimental line widths and relative intensities compared to the most intense $K_{\alpha,1}$ line are shown in \fref{tab:elements} with the usual naming convention illustrated in \fref{fig:levels}.   Roughly, the $K_{\alpha,1}$ line widths correspond to coherence times in the 0.4-0.8\,fs range \cite{krause1979}. The cross section for $K$-fluorescence is the highest just above the $K$-absorption edge and, for example for iron, an order of magnitude higher than the coherent cross section (see \fref{fig:cross}).

\section{Basic Concepts of Coherence}
In the following, for simplicity, all considered fields are initially assumed to be both stationary and ergodic: A process $f(t)$ is wide-sense stationary, if the expectation value $E[f(t)]$ is independent of the time $t$ and $E[f(t_1)f(t_2)]$ depends only on the time difference $\tau=f_1-f_2$. A process, for which the time average and the ensemble average are equal is called ergodic. Stationarity is a necessity for ergodicity \cite{goodman2000}. It can be shown, that the basic principles hold for non-ergodic fields with the main difference being, that all expectation values have to be taken over different realizations  \cite{lajunen04}.

Spherical waves as solutions of the wave equation in spherical coordinates,
\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}(\vec{r},t)=\vec{E}_0(\vec{k},t) \frac{e^{i\vec{r}\vec{k}-iwt}}{\left|\vec{r}\right|} \,,
\end{equation}
with wave vector $\vec{k}$ and angular frequency $\omega$ describe the electric field of light propagating isotropically in vacuum. 
The superposition principle allows the addition of two waves (with the real amplitudes $\vec{A}_{1,2}$ and phases $\phi_{1,2}$)
\begin{equation}
\vec{E}(\vec{r},t)=\vec{E_1}(\vec{r},t)+\vec{E_2}(\vec{r},t)=\vec{A_1}e^{i\phi_1}  e^{i\vec{r}\vec{k_1}-iw_1t} + \vec{A_2}e^{i\phi_1}  e^{i\vec{r}\vec{k_2}-iw_2t} 
\end{equation} 
The intensity measured at a point $\vec{r}$ with a measurement time $T$ will be
\begin{equation}
	I(\vec{r},t)\propto \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \left|E(\vec{r},t)\right|^2 \diff t
	\stackrel{T\gg1/w}{\propto}
    \left<\left|E(\vec{r},t)\right|^2\right> \,.
\end{equation}
The superposition of two monochromatic, stationary waves with a fixed phase difference $\Delta \phi$, such as a wave and its time delayed copy (\fref{fig:michelson}) in an interferometer, gives rise to interference fringes
\begin{align*}
	\left<I(\vec{r},t)\right> & = I_1+I_2+2\left<\operatorname{Re}({E_1(\vec{r},t)}E_2^*(\vec{r},t))\right> \\
	& = I_1+I_2+2\sqrt{I_1I_2}\cos\left((\vec{k_1}-\vec{k_2})\vec{r}+\Delta \phi\right)  \,.
	\numberthis
\label{eq:interference}
\end{align*}

Defining the contrast of the fringes as the visibility $V=\frac{I_{max}-I_{min}}{I_{max}+I_{min}}$,
results for equal intensities of the the waves in maximum contrast,  $V=\frac{2\sqrt{I*I}}{I+I}I=1$. In this case of a fixed phase difference, the waves are called \textit{coherent}.
If, on the other hand, the phase difference $\Delta \phi$ is not fixed but completely random and therefore averages out in \fref{eq:interference}, the visibility goes to 0 and the waves are regarded as \textit{incoherent}  \cite{born1980,goodman2000}.

To consider non monochromatic waves, we define the self coherence function $\Gamma$ as 
\begin{equation}
\Gamma(\tau)=\left< E(t)E(t+\tau)\right>
\end{equation}
and its normalized version, the complex degree of (self-)coherence $\gamma$, as
\begin{equation}
\gamma(\tau)=\frac{\Gamma(\tau)}{\Gamma(0)} =  \frac{\Gamma(\tau)}{\left<I(t)\right>} \,.
\end{equation} 
Now \fref{eq:interference} can be written as $I=I_{1}+I_{2}+2 \sqrt{I_{1} I_{2}} \operatorname{Re}\left[\gamma(\tau)\right]$ and (again for equal intensities) the visibility is $V(\tau)=\left|\gamma(\tau)\right|$ \cite{zernike1938,loudon2000}. As the Wiener-Khinchin theorem connects the power spectrum $F(w)$ with $\gamma$,
\begin{equation}
	F(\omega)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \gamma(\tau) \exp (\mathrm{i} \omega \tau)  \dif \tau \,,
\end{equation}
the visibility is a function of the fourier-transformed spectrum \cite{lajunen04}.

The \textit{coherence time} $\tau_c$ shall describe at which delay the visibility falls to approximately zero. One possible definition of the coherence time by Mandel based on the complex degree of coherence,
\begin{equation}
\tau_c = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left| \gamma(\tau)\right|^2 \diff \tau 
\end{equation} will be used in the following. Other definitions commonly used are equivalent up to a constant factor and lead generally to coherence times of the same order of magnitude \cite{mandel1959,goodman2000}. As a relevant example for inner shell fluorescence, for an exponentially decaying electric field envelope\footnote{Corresponding to an intensity/photon number decay with time constant $\sfrac{\tau}{2}$} $E(t)=\Theta(t)e^{-t/\tau_E}$, the power spectrum is Lorentzian with an angular frequency FWHM of $\Delta \omega=\frac{2}{\tau_E}$,
\begin{equation}
\left|\int_{0}^{\infty}  e^{-t/\tau_E} e^{-iwt} \dif t \right|^2 \propto  \frac{1}{1/\tau_E^2+w^2} \,,
\end{equation}
and numerator and denominator of the complex degree of coherence are
\begin{align*}
\left\langle E(t) E^{*}(t+\tau)\right\rangle
&=\int_{0}^{\infty} E(t) E^{*}(t+\tau)\diff t
=\frac{\tau_E}{2}   e^{-\frac{\left| \tau \right| }{\tau_E }}\\
\left\langle E(t) E^{*}(t)\right\rangle
&=\frac{\tau_E}{2}  \,.
\numberthis
\end{align*}
Hence, $\left<\gamma(\tau)\right>=e^{-|\tau/| \tau_E}$,  and the coherence time as defined is above is accordingly $\tau_c=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left| \gamma(\tau)\right|^2 \diff \tau=\tau_E=\sfrac{2\hbar}{\Delta E}$ \cite{goodman2000,pollnau2020}.

	\label{fig:michelson}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{First order coherence $g^1$}
A generalization of the complex degree of self coherence to different fields  $E_1^*(\vec{r}_1,t_1)$ and $E_2(\vec{r}_2,t_2)$ is the normalized first order correlation function $g^1$ \cite{agarwal2013}
\begin{equation}
	g^{(1)}(\vec{r}_1,t_1;\vec{r}_2,t_2)= \frac
	{\left< E_1^*(\vec{r}_1,t_1)E_2(\vec{r}_2,t_2) \right>}
	{\left[ \left<\left | E(\vec{r}_1,t_1)\right |^2 \right> \left< \left |E(\vec{r}_2,t_2)\right |^2 \right>\right]^{1/2}}	\,.
\end{equation}

This can be used, for example, to describe Young's double slit experiment (\fref{fig:doubleslit}): On the screen at point $\vec{r}$, the electrical field is 
\begin{equation}
	E(\vec{r}, t)=\frac{E\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t-R_{1} / c\right)}{R_{1}} e^{i\left[\vec{k}_{1} \cdot\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{1}\right)-\omega t\right]}+\frac{E\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t-R_{2} / c\right)}{R_{2}} e^{i\left[\vec{k}_{2} \cdot\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{2}\right)-\omega t\right]} \,.
\end{equation}
If the distances from $\vec{r}$ to the two slits are (approximately) equal, $R_{1}\approx R_{2} \approx d$, the intensity at $\vec{r}$ is
\begin{align*}
	&\left\langle I\left(\vec{r}, t^{\prime}\right)\right\rangle=\left\langle\left|E\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle+\left\langle\left|E\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right|^{2}\right\rangle 
	+\left[\left\langle E^{*}\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right) E\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right\rangle e^{i\left(\vec{k}_{1}-\vec{k}_{2}\right) \cdot \vec{r}+i \Delta \phi}+\text{c.c}\right] \\
	& \propto 1+
	\frac{2 \sqrt{\left< I\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right)\right>\left< I\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right>}}
	{\vphantom{2\sqrt{\left<I\left(\vec{r}_{1}\right)\right>}}\left< I\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right)\right>+\left< I\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right>}	
	\frac{\vphantom{2\sqrt{\left<I\left(\vec{r}_{1}\right)\right>}}\left|\left< E^{*}\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right) E\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right>\right|}
	{\vphantom{2\sqrt{\left<I\left(\vec{r}_{1}\right)\right>}}\sqrt{\left\langle I\left(\vec{r}_{1}, t\right)\right>\left\langle I\left(\vec{r}_{2}, t\right)\right>}}
	\cos \left[\left(\vec{k}_{1}-\vec{k}_{2}\right) \cdot \vec{r}+\Delta \phi\right]
	\numberthis
\end{align*}


and the visibility can be identified as the modulus of $g^1$ \cite{loudon2000,ou2017}.

\end{figure}



\paragraph{Second order coherence $g^2$}
The definition of $g^1$ can be extended to the second order by considering
\begin{equation}
	g^{(2)}(\vec{r}_1,t_1;\vec{r}_2,t_2)= 
	\frac{\left< E^*(\vec{r}_1,t_1)E^*(\vec{r}_2,t_2)E(\vec{r}_1,t_1)E(\vec{r}_2,t_2) \right>}{\left<\left | E(\vec{r}_1,t_1)\right |^2 \right> \left< \left |E(\vec{r}_2,t_2)\right |^2 \right>} \,.	
\end{equation}
For classical fields, this is equivalent  to normalized correlations of intensities \cite{goodman2000}:
\begin{equation}
	g^{(2)}(\vec{r}_1,t_1;\vec{r}_2,t_2)= 
		\frac{\left< I(\vec{r}_1,t_1)I(\vec{r}_2,t_2 \right>}{\left<I(\vec{r}_1,t_1)\right>\left<I(\vec{r}_2,t_2)\right>}	
		\label{eq:g2}
\end{equation}


\paragraph{Van Cittert–Zernike}
The Van Cittert–Zernike theorem establishes that in the far field, the coherence function of a 
quasi-monochromatic but spatially incoherent light source is proportional to the 2D Fourier transform intensity distribution of the source. Carter and Wolf introduced a generalization for three dimensional sources without the need for a small angle approximation, showing that in the case of an completely incoherent source field, the first order coherence in the far field is proportional to the 3D Fourier transform of the source's intensity distribution \cite{rosen1996, goodman2005, carter1981}:
\begin{equation}
	g^{(1)}(\vec{r}_1,\vec{r}_2) \propto I_0^{-1} \int_{S} I_s(\vec{r}) e^{ik(R_1-R_2)} \difc \vec{r} \approx I_0^{-1} \int_{S} I_s(\vec{r}) e^{-ik\vec{r}(\vec{r_1}-\vec{r_2})} \difc \vec{r}
	\label{eq:vcz}
\end{equation}
with the source volume $S$ and intensity distribution $I_s$, total source intensity $I_0=\int I_s(\vec{r}) \difc \vec{r}$ and distances $R_{1,2}=\left|\vec{r}_{1,2}-\vec{r}\right|$.


\section{Hanbury Brown Twiss Experiment}
Hanbury Brown and Twiss first used the correlation between the intensities captured by photomultiplier tubes to measure the angular size of stars  \cite{hanbury1956}. The underlying effect can be explained based on semi-classical coherence theory for chaotic light sources \cite{baym1997,goodman2000}:

If two sources $A$ and $B$ (in the original experiment different parts of the observed star) produce each spherical electromagnetic waves with random but constant phases $\phi_{A,B}$, such that (ignoring polarization) $E_{A,B}=c_{A,B} e^{i k\left|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{1,2}\right|+i \phi_{A,B}} /\left|\vec{r}-\vec{r}_{A,B}\right|$, the total intensity $I_{1}$ at detector 1 is
\begin{equation}
	I_{1} =
	\frac{1}{L^{2}}\left(
	|c_A|^{2}
	+|c_B|^{2}
	+c_A^{*} c_B     e^{ i\left(k\left(r_{1 b}-r_{1 a}\right)+\phi_{B}-\phi_{A}\right)}
	+c_A     c_B^{*} e^{-i\left(k\left(r_{1 b}-r_{1 a}\right)+\phi_{B}-\phi_{A}\right)}
	\right)
\end{equation}
with $r_{1 a}$ the distance from source $A$ to detector 1, etc., and analogously for detector 2.
Averaging over many independent realizations of the random phases leads to the average intensities in the two detectors,
\begin{equation}
	\left\langle I_{1}\right\rangle=\left\langle I_{2}\right\rangle=\frac{1}{L^{2}}\left(\left\langle|c_A|^{2}\right\rangle+\left\langle|c_B|^{2}\right\rangle\right) \,,
\end{equation}

independent of the separation of the sources. On the other hand, the average of the product of the intensities is
\begin{equation}
	\left\langle I_{1} I_{2}\right\rangle =
	\left\langle I_{1}\right\rangle\left\langle I_{2}\right\rangle+\frac{2}{L^{4}}|c_A|^{2}|c_B|^{2} \cos \left(k\left(r_{1 a}-r_{2 a}-r_{1 b}+r_{2 b}\right)\right) \,.
\end{equation}
Hence combining these to the normalized correlation (\fref{eq:g2}) results in
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\left\langle I_{1} I_{2}\right\rangle}{\left\langle I_{1}\right\rangle\left\langle I_{2}\right\rangle}
	=1+2 \frac{\left\langle|\alpha|^{2}\right\rangle\left\langle|\beta|^{2}\right\rangle}{\left(\left\langle|\alpha|^{2}\right\rangle+\left\langle|\beta|^{2}\right\rangle\right)^{2}} \cos \left(k\left(r_{1 a}-r_{2 a}-r_{1 b}+r_{2 b}\right)\right) \,.
\end{equation}

For a large enough distance between the sources and detectors $(L \gg R)$, the small angle approximation can be used, yielding
\begin{equation}
	g^2\left(\vec{k_1}-\vec{k_2}\right)-1\propto \cos{\left(\vec{R} \cdot\left(\vec{k}_{2}-\vec{k}_{1}\right)\right)} \,,
\end{equation} 
where $\vec{k}_{1,2}=k \vec{r}_{1,2}$ is the wave vector of the light seen in detector $1$/detector $2$. As the modulation frequency of the the intensity correlation is depended on $R$, the separation of the two sources, i.e. the size of the star, can be recovered. If the random phases of the two sources are not stationary during the measurement, but slowly changing resulting in a finite coherence time, only photons arriving on the detector within approximately this coherence time will create the interference and in the correlation measurement a number of independent modes will be overlaid \cite{goodman2000}.

\section{Incoherent Diffractive Imaging}
Based on the HBT experiment, a simplified explanation of Incoherent Diffractive Imaging can easily be made for thermal light sources in a classical view by application of the Siegert relation.

$\left<ABCD\right>=\left<AB\right>\left<CD\right>+\left<AC\right>\left<BD\right>+\left<AD\right>\left<BC\right>$ can be used to factorize \fref{eq:g2}. This leads,  independently of the spatial configuration of the sources, to
\begin{equation}
	g^2(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2}) = 1+ |g^1(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2}) |^2 .
\end{equation}
This relation of the first and second order correlation function is known as the \textit{Siegert Relation} \cite{ou2017}. 

As, as according to the van Cittert–Zernike theorem (\fref{eq:vcz}), $g^1$ encodes structural information, 
\begin{equation}
	g^1(\vec{k_1},\vec{k_2}) \propto \mathscr{F}S(\vec{r}) = S(\vec{q}) \,,
\end{equation}
the difference of the intensity-intensity correlation from unity is proportional  to the Fourier transform of the arrangement of emitters with $q=\vec{k_1}-\vec{k_2}$ (see \fref{fig:scatteringvectors}). 
This is the basic principle used in IDI to recover three dimensional spatial information from the intensity correlation.

In IDI, there is no momentum transfer from the incoming to the outgoing wave. Instead, intensity correlations of different $k_1$, $k_2$ give access to the scattering factor at $\Delta\vec{q}$ according to the Siegert relation.}

A more detailed quantum mechanical treatment considers the mixtures of the probability amplitudes of emission and detection at the two detectors as the individual paths are indistinguishable, leading what was shown as an equivalent description of the HBT effect for thermal light sources \cite{fano1961,sudarshan1963,glauber2006}.  The quantum mechanical description additionally allows the treatment of non-classical light sources such as single photon emitters \cite{mandel1995,classen2017}. This introduces a correction term to the equivalent of the Siegert relation of the order of $1/N$ with $N$ the number of emitters,
\begin{equation}
	g^2(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2}) = 1+ |g^1(\vec{r_1},\vec{r_2}) |^2 - \frac{2}{N} ,
\end{equation}
which, for the considered cases of many fluorescence emitting atoms, is negligible.


\section{Photon Statistics in Speckle Patterns}
Before continuing with investigation of IDI, some general semi-classical statistical aspects of speckle patterns are useful.
Considering a complex sum of many phasors (e.g. the superposition of many electrical fields or probability amplitudes) of constant amplitude $A$ and independent uniformly in $(-\pi,\pi]$ distributed phases $\phi_k$, $c=\sum^N_k A e^{i\phi_k}$, for sufficiently large numbers of $N$, the real and imaginary parts
\begin{align*}
	r&=\operatorname{Re}(c) =  A \sum^N_k \cos(\phi_k) &
	i&= \operatorname{Im}(c) =A \sum^N_k \sin(\phi_k)
	\numberthis
\end{align*}
will (by Central Limit Theorem) be Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2=\frac{N}{2}A^2$, the probability distribution of the amplitude $a=\sqrt(r^2+i^2)$ will be a Rayleigh distribution
\begin{equation}
	p(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} a e^{\frac{a^2}{2\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}
and  $I=\left|a\right|^2$ will follow an exponential distribution
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:expdistr}
	p(I)=\frac{ e^{-I/\overline{I}}}{\overline{I}}
\end{equation} 
with mean $\overline{I}$ and standard deviation $\sigma=\overline{I}$  \cite{goodman2000,goodman1976}.
A sum of $M$ uncorrelated random variables following identical distributions given by \fref{eq:expdistr} follows a Gamma distribution,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gammadistr}
	p_M(I)=\frac{I^{M-1} e^{-I/\overline{I}}} {\overline{I}^M \Gamma(M)}.
\end{equation}
For a positive integer $M$ this simplifies with $\Gamma(M)=(M-1)!$ to an Erlang distribution  \cite{forbes2010}.
If $I$ is distributed like \fref{eq:gammadistr} and furthermore Poisson sampled as discrete $k$ (such as photon counts in the semi-classical picture), it is negative binomial distributed,
\cite{trost2020,mandel1959,holmes2019}
\begin{equation}
	p_M(k)=
	\frac{\Gamma(k+M)}{\Gamma(M)\Gamma(k+1) }
	\left( 1+\frac{1}{\overline{I}}
	\right)^{-k}
	\left( 1+\overline{I}
	\right)^{-M}
	\label{eq:negbinomialdist}
\end{equation}
with mean $\mu=M\overline{I}$ and variance $\mu+\frac{\mu^2}{M}$ (which is higher than the variance of the Poisson distribution $\mu$ ).

This probability distribution can be compared to an experimental measured photon count distribution and the number of independent modes $M$ overlaid in the speckle pattern can be estimated by a regression for small mode numbers \cite{lehmkuhler2014,yun2019}. 
For low photon numbers, a simplified approach can be used by only considering single- and two-photon events: By considering the ratio of the probabilities of those events, $p(1) / p(2)$,  an expression for the number of modes can be found, which can be simplified with a low intensity approximation $\mu\approx p(1)+2p(2)+O(\mu^2)$ to 
\begin{equation}
	M=\frac{\mu  (p(1)-2 p(2))}{2 p(2)-\mu  p(1)}\approx \frac{p(1)^2}{2 p(2) (1-p(1))-p(1)^2}
	\label{eq:modesp1p2}
\end{equation}
as an estimation for the number of modes.
If $p(1)$ and $p(2)$ are estimated as $p'_1$ and $p'_2$ based on the frequency in experimental observations, the uncertainty of the mode estimate can be estimated as 
$\Delta M \lesssim \frac{2 p'_1}{\left({p'_1}^2+2 (p'_1-1) p'_2\right)^2} \left(\Delta p'_1 (2-p'_1) p'_2+\Delta p'_2 (1-p'_1) p'_1\right)$.

\section{Signal to Noise Considerations}
\label{sec:specklecontrast}
The Signal to Noise characteristics of IDI are determined by the signal strength and the noise:
The signal strength is determined by $\left|S(q)\right|^2$, which is dependent on the sample, and the contrast of the recorded speckle image. The noise in the measurement will consist of three parts: First, noise inherent to IDI caused by the random distribution of phases, second, the Poissonian shot noise caused by quantized photons, and third, systematic experimental noise \cite{trost2020, goodman2007}. 

\paragraph{Speckle Contrast}
The speckle contrast $\beta =\sqrt{\tfrac{1}{M}}$ is governed by the number of independent modes $M$ overlaid in the measurement (in the quantum mechanical interpretation, these correspond to different, distinguishable non-interfering N-photon states) \cite{goodman2000,ou2017,classen2019}.
If the measurement is performed over a finite amount of time, the number of temporal modes is
\begin{equation}
M_t=\frac{\left(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(t)\diff t\right)^2}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} K(t) \left|\mu(t)\right|^2\diff t} \,,
\label{eq:modes}
\end{equation}
where $P(t)$ is the integration window weighting function and $K(t)$ its autocorrelation \cite{goodman2007}. If the integration window is set by the integration time $T$ of the detector, $P(t)$ is a rectangular function with the width $T$ and
\begin{align*}
	M_{t,\text{rect}} =T \left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \Lambda\left(\frac{t}{T}\right) \left|\mu(t)\right|^2 \diff t \right]^{-1} \,, \numberthis \\
\text{with  }\Lambda(x) = \begin{cases} 
 1-\left|x\right|& \textit{if }|x|<1\\
0 & \textit{otherwise}\\  
\end{cases} \,.
\label{eq:modesapprox}
\end{align*}
Considering the case of a long integration time, $T\gg\tau$, this can be approximated as $M\approx\frac{T}{\tau}$. For a short integration time,  $T\ll\tau$, the number of temporal modes $M$ approaches unity.

If the Integration time can be considered as infinite and instead $P(t)$ is a Gaussian excitation pulse with FWHM of $2\sigma\sqrt{2\ln2}$, creating to a non-stationary field, this leads to
\begin{equation}
	M_{t,\text{Gauss}}=e^{\frac{4 \sigma ^2}{\tau ^2}} \text{erfc}\left(\frac{2 \sigma }{\tau }\right),
	\label{eq:mgauss}
\end{equation}
with the complementary error function $\erfc=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_x^\infty e^{-z^2}\diff z$. 

Inoue et al. considered $P$ to be the Gaussian excitation pulse convoluted with an exponential decay with lifetime $\tau$ \cite{inoue2019,butz2015},
\begin{align}
P(t)&=\frac{1}{\tau\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-\frac{t^{\prime}}{\tau}} 
e^{-\frac{(t-t^{\prime})^2}{2\sigma^2}}\diff t^{\prime}
=\frac{1}{2\tau}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}+\frac{\sigma^2}{2\tau^2}}
\erfc\left[
\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{2}\tau}
-\frac{t}{\sqrt{2}\sigma}
	\right] .
	\label{eq:pfull}
	\end{align}
An approximation can be made if the pulse length is long in comparison to the coherence time, simplifying the auto-correlation of $P$ to
\begin{align}
K(t)&=\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{1}{4
	\tau ^2}e^{-\frac{t^2}{2 \sigma ^2}-\frac{(t+t')^2}{2 \sigma ^2}}
\erfcx\left(\frac{\sigma^2 -t \tau }{\sqrt{2} \tau \sigma}\right)
\erfcx\left(\frac{\sigma^2 -\tau  (t+t')}{\sqrt{2} \tau \sigma }\right) \diff t' \nonumber \\
&\stackrel{\tau \rightarrow 0}{\approx} \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\pi}\sigma} e^{-\left(\frac{t}{2\sigma}\right)^2} 
\label{eq:kapprox}
\end{align}
with the scaled complementary error function\footnote{To numerically evaluate \fref{eq:mgauss}, \fref{eq:pfull} and integrals involving them, the introduction of the scaled complementary error function and switching to a sufficient approximation is beneficial to avoid under- or overflow of the numerical representation of either the exponential or the error function term.} $\erfcx(x)=e^{x^2}\erfc(x)\stackrel{x\gg1}{\approx}  \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}x}$
   \cite{ren2007}.
The number of degrees of freedom, $M_{t,\text{Conv}}=\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} K(t) \left|\mu(t)\right|^2\diff t\right]^{-1}$  can then be numerically evaluated  for a Lorentzian spectrum as shown in \fref{fig:theorymodes}.

In the limit of longer excitation pulses, the number of modes increases linear with the pulse duration, $M\approx \frac{\text{FWHM}}{\tau_c} \sqrt{\frac{\pi} {2 \ln{2}}}$.  Additionally, the results of applying the mode estimation   (\fref{eq:modesp1p2}) to simulated fluorescence images as described in \fref{sec:timedependend} is shown (see there for more details on the simulation). \textbf{(b)} Photon statistics with different numbers of modes $M$ and equal mean of 0.1\,photons. A lower number of modes corresponds the an higher probability of observing multi photon events. The limit of a high number of modes is a Poisson distribution.}
\end{figure}

Beside these temporal modes, the experimentally indistinguishable fluorescence energies $K_{\alpha,1}$ and $K_{\alpha,2}$ (as well as  $K_\beta$ if no filter is used for suppression) give additional independent spectral modes $M_E$, depending on the relative intensity of the lines, with $M_E \lessapprox 2$ for the elements considered in this work (see \fref{tab:elements}).

As the used X-ray detectors are polarization insensitive and the X-ray fluorescence is unpolarized, the incoherent field can be separated into two polarization modes with independent random phase, which are pairwise orthogonal with $\vec{k}$ and therefore change slightly for each atom and detector position. For small source dimensions, this change is negligible,  giving constant $M_P \approx 2$ \cite{classen2019}. 

Path differences longer than the coherence length give additional modes $M_S$, therefore the speckle visibility will be reduced for large samples. This is for example important, if the exciting beam is not perpendicular to the detector (such as in an off-axis setup), as the excitation time difference between different parts of the a thick sample is not compensated for by the difference in flight time to the detector or in a wide angle experiment. In a small angle setup with a detector perpendicular to the beam, fluorescence from different emitters along the sample thickness will arrive at approximately equal time, hence the sample thickness should not introduce additional modes). To illustrate this effect, simulations will be performed in \fref{chap:simulation}.

If the speckle pattern is not spatially resolved by the detector because its resolution is too low compared to the change in intensity, undersampling will occur, the measured signal will be spatially averaged giving independent spatial sampling modes $M_D$ \cite{goodman2007}.

Even though the number of from the different effects discussed above are not completely independent, as an approximation and upper bound on the reduction in contrast, the total number of modes might be estimated as the product of the respective upper bounds. 


\paragraph{Estimation of the Noise}
The variance of a product of uncorrelated photon counts following the negative binomial distribution of \fref{eq:negbinomialdist} is
\begin{equation}
	\Var_{p\cdot p}= \Var_p^2 +2 \mu^2\Var_p	= \mu^4 \frac{2 M + 1}{M^2 + 2}+ \mu^3 \frac{M+1}{M} + \mu^2 \,.
\end{equation}
Assuming no correlations, this would describe the inherent noise in the measurement of the fluorescence. The last term, dominating in the low photon count regime, can be considered as the Poissonian character of the noise, whereas the other terms, dominating at high photon counts, the phase noise.
As shown by Trost et. al, this can be used to estimate the inherent noise of an intensity correlation measurement, even though the actual signal will break the assumption of having uncorrelated photon counts \cite{trost2020}.

\paragraph{Signal to Noise Ratio}
Combining the squared contrast of the speckle pattern, the expectation value of the product of the photon counts, the standard deviation as a quantification of the noise, and the number of independent measurements $N$ over which an average is taken, finally gives 
\begin{equation}
SNR\propto  \frac{|S(q)|^2 \mu\sqrt{N}}{M\sqrt{\mu^2 \frac{2 M + 1}{M^2 + 2}+ \mu \frac{M+1}{M} + 1}}
\label{eq:snr}
\end{equation}
as an estimation of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), which will be further examined by performing simulations in \fref{chap:simulation}.
%Which factors influence SNR -lifetime/pulsewidth -polarisation -sampling conditions / undersampling -sample thickness / coherence length -N images -N photons

\section{Kossel Lines}
\label{sec:kossel}
X-ray radiation  originating from \textit{within} a single crystal, i.e. fluorescence, can be Bragg reflected at the lattice planes of the crystal, causing intensity variations in $90^o-\theta_{hkl}$ around the direction perpendicular to the planes described by the Laue indices $hkl$, $\vec{k}_{hkl}$, with $\theta_{hkl}$ the corresponding Bragg angle, forming the \textit{Kossel Cones} \cite{cowley1995}. On the spherical detector centered at at the crystal, the points with influenced intensity, the \textit{Kossel lines} (or, as they are more commonly called in electron microscopy, \text{Kikuchi lines}) would hence lie on circles, for a flat detector on general conic sections (see \fref{fig:kossel} for an illustration).

The visibility of the Kossel lines is governed by the same extinction rules as for the Bragg reflexes -- the structure factor $F_{hkl}$ has to be non-zero \cite{cowley1995}. For a zinc blende structure (such as GaAs) with atomic scattering factors $f_a$ and $f_b$, the structure factor is
\begin{align}
F_{hkl} = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if $h$, $k$, $l$ mixed parity}\\
4(f_a+f_b) & \text{if same parity and $h+k+l = 4 N$} \\
4(f_a\pm i f_b)& \text{if same parity and $h+k+l = 2 N+1$} \\
4(f_a-f_b) & \text{if same parity and $h+k+l = 4 N+2$,}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
resulting in strong Kossel lines if $h+k+l=4N$ with integer $N$  \cite{reimer2013}.

The fine structure of the intensity variations and whether they increase or decrease the intensity over the non-scattered fluorescence background depends furthermore on the viewing direction along the cone in relation to the orientation and crystal surface \cite{faigel2016}. If the fine structure cannot be resolved by the detector and only the presence, overall shape and position of the lines is considered, no distinction between these different cases has to be explicitly made.

As each point identified as belonging to a Kossel line has to be part of a conic section of the same plane with each cone originating from the same point, each point $\vec{r}$ on a line has to fulfill

\begin{equation}
\frac{\vec{r} \cdot \vec{q}}{\left|\vec{r}\right| \left| \vec{q}\right|} = \frac{\lambda}{2d} \,,
\end{equation}
 for a reciprocal lattice vector $\vec{q}$ which is an element of the allowed reflections $Q$, wavelength $\lambda$ and lattice spacing $d$.

On a planar detector, the intersections of the Kossel cones are visible as conic sections (right).}
