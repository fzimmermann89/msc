  abstract  = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input--output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

Twiss demonstrated another technique that probes quantum-mechanical correlations in the electromagnetic field. Splitting an incoherent light beam, they found that photon detections in the two daughter beams were correlated: the photons were bunching together. This corresponds to a correlation in the intensity of light in the two beams, which Hanbury-Brown and Twiss suggested could be used to infer the angular size of distant stars. Physicists now rely on the effect to probe the quantum character of complex light sources. {$[$}Obituary of Robert Hanbury Brown: Nature 416, 34 (2002){$]$}},

Fractional contributions to the extra non-line intensity from the multiplet structure, the skewness effect and from radiative Auger processes have been evaluated, indicating that the multiplet structure is of major importance for Cr and Fe, while radiative Auger processes are dominant for Ni and Cu. The three effects yield about the same magnitude of extra non-line intensity in the case of Co. The radiative Auger processes give a relative intensity of approximately the same magnitude, i.e. approximately 8% of the main line peak intensity, for all the elements in question and for both the alpha 1 line and the alpha 2 line.},

Although this was known for a long time, experimental realization has not been presented. In this work we demonstrate experimentally that phases can be directly determined from the profile of the Kossel lines. These measurements are interesting not only theoretically, but they would facilitate structure solution of samples within extreme conditions, such as high pressure, high and low temperatures, high magnetic fields and extremely short times. The parallel measurement of many diffraction lines on a stationary sample will allow a more efficient use of the new generation of x-ray sources the X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs).},

The distribution depends strongly on the degeneracy of the light beam. It approaches the Poisson form for classical particles at low degeneracies and the distribution characteristic of classical waves at high degeneracies. The analysis leads, incidentally, to an expression for the extent of the unit cell of phase space in the direction of the beam.

This note presents a closed-form approximation for the error, complementary error, and scaled complementary error functions, with maximum relative errors within 0.8\%. Unlike other approximate solutions, this single equation gives answers within the stated accuracy for real variable x ∈ [0∞). The approximation is very useful in solving atmospheric science problems by providing analytical solutions. Examples of the utility of the approximation are: the computation of cirrus cloud physics inside a general circulation model, the cumulative distribution functions of normal and log-normal distributions, and the recurrence period for risk assessment.

If molecular motion is insignificant during exposure, then differences in momentum transfer between correlated photons are direct measurements of the molecular structure. In conventional small- and wide-angle solution scattering, photon correlations are ignored. This report presents advances in a new biomolecular structural analysis technique, correlated X-ray scattering (CXS), which uses angular intensity correlations to recover hidden structural details from molecules in solution. Due to its intense rapid pulses, an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) is an excellent tool for CXS experiments. A protocol is outlined for analysis of a CXS data set comprising a total of half a million X-ray exposures of solutions of small gold nanoparticles recorded at the Spring-8{\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m Compact XFEL facility (SACLA). From the scattered intensities and their correlations, two populations of nanoparticle domains within the solution are distinguished: small twinned, and large probably non-twinned domains. It is shown analytically how, in a solution measurement, twinning information is only accessible {\it via} intensity correlations, demonstrating how CXS reveals atomic-level information from a disordered solution of like molecules.},

  abstract = {Modern direct electron detectors (DEDs) provided a giant leap in the use of cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to study the structures of macromolecules and complexes thereof. However, the currently available commercial DEDs, all based on the monolithic active pixel sensor, still require relative long exposure times and their best results have only been obtained at 300 keV. There is a need for pixelated electron counting detectors that can be operated at a broader range of energies, at higher throughput and higher dynamic range. Hybrid Pixel Detectors (HPDs) of the Medipix family were reported to be unsuitable for cryo-EM at energies above 80 keV as those electrons would affect too many pixels. Here we show that the Timepix3, part of the Medipix family, can be used for cryo-EM applications at higher energies. We tested Timepix3 detectors on a 200 keV FEI Tecnai Arctica microscope and a 300 keV FEI Tecnai G2 Polara microscope. A correction method was developed to correct for per-pixel differences in output. Timepix3 data were simulated for individual electron events using the package Geant4Medipix. Global statistical characteristics of the simulated detector response were in good agreement with experimental results. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using the simulated data to predict the incident position of the electron within a pixel cluster. After training, the CNN predicted, on average, 0.50 pixel and 0.68 pixel from the incident electron position for 200 keV and 300 keV electrons respectively. The CNN improved the MTF of experimental data at half Nyquist from 0.39 to 0.70 at 200 keV, and from 0.06 to 0.65 at 300 keV respectively. We illustrate that the useful dose-lifetime of a protein can be measured within a 1 second exposure using Timepix3.},

In this paper, we describe a number of developments in the generation of ultrashort X-ray FEL pulses, and the concomitant progress in the experimental capabilities necessary for their characterization and use at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This includes the development of sub-femtosecond hard and soft X-ray pulses, along with ultrafast characterization techniques for these pulses. We also describe improved techniques for optical cross-correlation as needed to address the persistent challenge of external optical laser synchronization with these ultrashort X-ray pulses.

The efficiency and quality of three-dimensional (3-D) structure reconstruction largely depends on the computational speed and alignment accuracy of this crucial step. In order to improve the performance of alignment, we introduce a new method that takes advantage of the highly accurate interpolation scheme based on the gridding method, a version of the nonuniform fast Fourier transform, and utilizes a multi-dimensional optimization algorithm for the refinement of the orientation parameters. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by using less than half of the sample points and taking twice the runtime, our new 2-D alignment method achieves dramatically better alignment accuracy than that based on quadratic interpolation. We also apply our method to image to volume registration, the key step in the single particle EM structure refinement protocol. We find that in this case the accuracy of the method not only surpasses the accuracy of the commonly used real-space implementation, but results are achieved in much shorter time, making gridding-based alignment a perfect candidate for efficient structure determination in single particle analysis.},

  abstract       = {X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) enables the study of sample dynamics between micrometer and atomic length scales. As a coherent scattering technique, it benefits from the increased brilliance of the next-generation synchrotron radiation and Free-Electron Laser (FEL) sources. In this article, we will introduce the XPCS concepts and review the latest developments of XPCS with special attention on the extension of accessible time scales to sub-μs and the application of XPCS at FELs. Furthermore, we will discuss future opportunities of XPCS and the related technique X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy (XSVS) at new X-ray sources. Due to its particular signal-to-noise ratio, the time scales accessible by XPCS scale with the square of the coherent flux, allowing to dramatically extend its applications. This will soon enable studies over more than 18 orders of magnitude in time by XPCS and XSVS.},

The pulse structure and the unprecedented brightness will allow one for the first time to study fast dynamics in the time domain, thus giving direct access to the dynamic response function S(Q,t), instead of S(Q,ω), which is of central importance for a variety of phenomena such as fast non-equilibrium dynamics initiated, e.g. by a short pump pulse. X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) measures the temporal changes in speckle patterns produced when coherent light is scattered by a disordered system and therefore allows to measure S(Q,t). This paper summarizes important aspects of the scientific case for an XPCS instrument at the planned XFEL. Novel XPCS set-ups are illustrated.},

Phase objects can lead to spurious contrast in x-ray diffraction images (topographs) of crystals. It is shown that this contrast can be eliminated through random phase plates, which provide an effective way of tailoring the angular size of the source. The possibilities of this very simple technique for imaging phase objects in the hard x-ray range are explored experimentally and discussed. They appear very promising, as shown in particular by the example of a piece of human vertebra, and could be extended to phase tomography.},

  abstract = {The degree of spectral coherence characterizes the spectral purity of light. It can be equivalently expressed in the time domain by the decay time τ or the quality factor Q of the light-emitting oscillator, the coherence time τ coh or length ℓcoh of emitted light or, via Fourier transformation to the frequency domain, the linewidth Δν of emitted light. We quantify these parameters for the reference situation of a passive Fabry-Pérot resonator. We investigate its spectral line shapes, mode profiles, and Airy distributions and verify that the sum of all mode profiles generates the corresponding Airy distribution. The Fabry-Pérot resonator is described, as an oscillator, by its Lorentzian linewidth and finesse and, as a scanning spectrometer, by its Airy linewidth and finesse. Furthermore, stimulated and spontaneous emission are analyzed semi-classically by employing Maxwell′s equations and the law of energy conservation. Investigation of emission by atoms inside a Fabry-Pérot resonator, the Lorentz oscillator model, the Kramers-Kronig relations, the amplitude-phase diagram, and the summation of quantized electric fields consistently suggests that stimulated and spontaneous emission of light occur with a phase 90° in lead of the incident field. These findings question the quantum-optical picture, which proposed, firstly, that stimulated emission occurred in phase, whereas spontaneous emission occurred at an arbitrary phase angle with respect to the incident field and, secondly, that the laser linewidth were due to amplitude and phase fluctuations induced by spontaneous emission. We emphasize that the first derivation of the Schawlow-Townes laser linewidth was entirely semi-classical but included the four approximations that (i) it is a truly continuous-wave (cw) laser, (ii) it is an ideal four-level laser, (iii) its resonator exhibits no intrinsic losses, and (iv) one photon is coupled spontaneously into the lasing mode per photon-decay time τc of the resonator, independent of the pump rate. After discussing the inconsistencies of existing semi-classical and quantum-optical descriptions of the laser linewidth, we introduce the spectral-coherence factor, which quantifies spectral coherence in an active compared to its underlying passive mode, and derive semi-classically, based on the principle that the gain elongates the photon-decay time and narrows the linewidth, the fundamental linewidth of a single lasing mode. This linewidth is valid for lasers with an arbitrary energy-level system, operating below, at, or above threshold and in a cw or a transient lasing regime, with the gain being smaller, equal, or larger compared to the losses. By applying approximations (i)-(iv) we reproduce the original Schawlow-Townes equation. It provides the hitherto missing link between the description of the laser as an amplifier of spontaneous emission and the Schawlow-Townes equation. Spontaneous emission entails that in a cw lasing mode the gain is smaller than the losses. We verify that also in the quantum-optical approaches to the laser linewidth, based on the density-operator master equation, the gain is smaller than the losses. We conclude this work by presenting the derivation of the laser linewidth in a nut shell.},

In this paper, numerical modeling is presented to show how the data interpretation of visibility spectroscopy can be impacted by the nonidealities of real-life X-ray detectors. Using simulated detector data, this work provides a detailed analysis of the systematic errors of several contrast extraction algorithms in the context of low-count-rate X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy and their origins are discussed. Here, it was found that the finite detector charge cloud and pixel size lead to an unavoidable `degeneracy' in photon position determination, and that the contrasts extracted using different algorithms can all be corrected by a simple linear model. The results suggest that experimental calibration of the correction coefficient at the count rate of interest is possible and essential. This allows computationally lightweight algorithms to be implemented for on-the-fly analysis.},
